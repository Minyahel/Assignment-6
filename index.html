                    Hello, my name is Minyahel Fekadu. I'm a software engineering student at Addis <br>Ababa University. Besides that, i'm 
                    an avid sports lover and a casual gamer.
                    <img src="./asset/images/man-in-black-jacket-771742.jpg" width="170" alt="profile picture" align="right"> 
                    <h2>Software Engineer</h2><p> I have always been interested in computers and anything related to them since I was 
                    a little kid. But, apart from just fiddling and playing with them I didn't really have any 
                    coding experience until I entered the 9<sup>th</sup> grade. But from then on, my knowledge of programming has grown
                    steadly. The first programming language I learned was C++ in highschool. Altough I don't remember much of it now,
                    I can credit nearly all of my software engineering interest to it since it showed me how fun and interesting
                    programming can be. In my first year as a software engineering student, I learned python which I beleive is 
                    a great programming language for begginers. Following that, in my second year, I learned Java. Apart from being 
                    one of the most popular programming language in the world, I found Java and still find Java to be a lot of fun.</p>
                    <h2>My Blood is Red</h2> 
                    <center><img src="./asset/images/man utd.png" width="200" alt="manchester united logo" ></center><br>
                    <p>Since I started watching sports from a
                    young age, I have been interested in one and only one team, The Reds, Manchester United. Over the years watching 
                    United play became one of my favorite passtimes and eventually evolved from being just a hobby to a culture.I cherish the 90 minutes 
                    of fun, sad and sometimes outright boring games and they have given me a greater connection with my father and brother who are also
                    avid Manchester United fans. While United is not what it used be under Sir Alex Ferguson, it's form has been improving this season and
                    i'm all the happier for it. With the recent coronavirus outbreak, it seems matches are going to get postponed
                    and cancelled which will leave me without a source of recreation. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Gamers Unite</h2> 
                    <p>Playing games is one of my favorite recreational activities. From an early age, I liked gaming like any child would
                    but as time went on I found games as a way to let my creativity loose. Instead of the old and boring first person shooter games, 
                    I am much more into sandbox that allow the player to explore and create anything of their liking. These kind of games test a 
                    persons creativity and help exercise the mind. There are many games in this genre and I've tried out many of them but below are some
                    of the games that I really enjoyed</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt><h3>Minecraft</h3></dt>
                        <center><img src="./asset/images/minecraft.jpg" width="300" alt="minecraft logo"></center>
                        <dd>Arguably one of the most addictive games ever created, it's pixelated and endless procedurally-generated world will have you up late at night 
                        trying to recreate the pyramid of giza<br></dd><br>
                        <dt>BeamNG.drive</dt>
                        <dd>An open world driving simulator with a soft-body physics engine unlike any other. This game has realistic damage to vehicles and will surely
                        be a favorite for those back-yard scientists</dd><br>
                        <dt>No Man's Sky</dt>
                        <center><img src="./asset/images/no man's sky.jpg" width="300" alt="no man's sky image"></center>
                        <dd>Yet another procedurally generated open world game only this time, the world is the universe consisting of millions of stars and their planets. Definitely
                        recommended for those who just can't help but look up to the sky at night</dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>The games above are what I would consider the best games ever and I would recommend anyone looking for a challenge to try them out.</p>
