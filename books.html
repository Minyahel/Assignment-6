                        Reading is one of my favorite passtimes and I have been doing it since I was a little kid.
                        I read whatever I can get my hands on whenver I can get my hands on it.
                        Books are the greatest way to develop one's mind and to learn a lot and I have first hand experience on that matter.<br><br>
                        With that said, I am not to keen to disclose that I don't have a copy of the many books I have read that I think are absolutely wonderful.
                        Below are some of the books that I have read that I enjoyed and would recommend to anyone.
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Ninteen Eighty Four(1984) by <i>George Orwell</i></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    A book published in 1949 whose predictions about the future are becoming more real everyday, now it can't get better than that.
                                    This bleakly dystopian novel written by George Orwell about the dangers of totalitariansim warns against a world where governed by propoganda, surveillance and censorship.<br>
                                    The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, 
                                    and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute 
                                    individuality and independent thinking.Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not exist. The protagonist, 
                                    Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks
                                    to break free from opression.<br><br>

                            <dt>The Great Gatsby by <i>F. Scott Fitzgerald</i></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    The story is of a fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his new love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Told from the prespective of Nick Carraway who moves to New York after World War I
                                    to pursue a career in bonds. He recounts the events of the summer he spent two years later. The style of the book is wry, sophisticated and elegiac, employing extended metaphors.
                                    This is considered one of the greatest American Novels and after reading it, one can easily understand why.<br><br>

                            <dt>Great Expectations by <i>Charles Dickens</i></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Great Expectations is the story of Pip, an orpahn boy adopted by a blacksmith's family, who has good luck and great expectations, and then loses both his luck and his expectations.
                                    Through the rise and fall, however, Pip learns how to find happiness. He learns the meaning of friendship and the meaning of love and, of course, becomes a better person for it.
                                    This was the penultimate novel by Charles Dickens and it recceived universal acclaim upon its release. It is still considered as one of the greatest novels ever written.<br><br>

                            <dt>Steve Jobs by <i>Walter Isaacson</i></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    This is the self-titled biography of Steve Jobs who played a pivotal role in the development and popularisation of personal computers and transformed many other industries. Written 
                                    by Isaacson whose other works include the biographies of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, this book the riveting and roller-coaster life and the searingly intense personality 
                                    of a creative entrepreneur. Based on more than fortty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years-as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries,

                            <dt>Churchill: Walking With Destiny by <i>Andrew Roberts</i></dt>
                                <dd>
                                    A landmark reconsideration of the iconoclastic war leader, based on extensive new material, from private letters to war cabinet meetings, by the bestselling, award-winning author of 
                                    Napoleon and The Storm of War.Roberts was granted exclusive access to extensive new material: the transcripts of war cabinet meetings - the equivalent of the Nixon and JFK tapes - diaries,
                                    letters, unpublished memoirs, and detailed notes taken by the king after their bi-weekly meetings. Having read every one of Churchill's letters, including deeply personal ones that 
                                    Churchill's son Randolph had previously chosen to withhold, and spoken to more than one hundred people who knew or worked with him, Roberts identifies the hidden forces fueling Churchill's drive. 
                                    Churchill put his faith in the British Empire and fought as hard to preserve it as he did to defend London. Having started his career in India and South Africa, he understood better than most 
                                    idealists how hard it can be to pacify reluctant people far from home.<br><br>
