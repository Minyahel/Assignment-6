                        While I always recommend upgrading to the latest and greatest version of whatever software you’re using, 
                        this might not be the best option if you’re running an older device that’s already struggling to function.
                         This is especially true of operating systems—although sometimes even your older device can benefit from an OS upgrade.<br><br>
                        First, I’d want to do a little more digging to see if your laptop truly can’t support Windows 10. It’s possible 
                        that your initial upgrade process went south for some unknown reason. Your laptop’s manufacturer might be correct,
                        but I’d want to confirm your device’s ineligibility at least one more time before writing off the latest version of Microsoft’s OS.<br><br>
                        There used to be an “upgrade compatibility checker” tool that you could run within Windows 7 to see whether your
                        system would have any issues upgrading Windows 10. I believe Microsoft has long since removed that from the OS,
                        but in case I’m wrong, you’d find it as an option in the “Get Windows 10" app that would be in the lower-right 
                        corner of your system’s Taskbar.<br><br>
                        Otherwise, I believe you can download and run Microsoft’s Windows 10 Update Assistant, which should run a check to
                        verify your system can handle Windows 10 (and it’ll also tell you what version you should upgrade to).<br><br>
                        I don’t have a copy of Windows 7 on hand, so I can’t walk you through the process directly. If your computer can 
                        run the latest OS—or if you want to give it a shot, anyway—I believe the Update Assistant will indicate that you
                        should download Windows 10 via Microsoft’s Media Creation Tool. Even if it doesn’t, or if it kicks off the upgrade
                        process itself, I recommend canceling out and using this tool to create an Windows 10 installation image on a separate
                        piece of media. A flash drive is best, but you can also burn a DVD.<br><br>
                        <center><img src="./asset/images/create dvd.webp" width="600" alt="windows 10 dvd installation"></center><br><br><br>
                        You’ll want to make sure you’re performing a “clean” installation of Windows 10 instead of any kind of “in-place upgrade.”
                        That’ll give you the best possible chance to avoid any issues during the installation process. That’s not to say you
                        won’t encounter problems—since you already mentioned you had one the last time you tried to upgrade—but I’d give it 
                        one more whirl to see if this helps.<br><br>
                        Before you begin the upgrade, it’s worth making a complete backup of your system. I recommend making an image that you
                        can then use to restore your laptop exactly the way it was should the upgrade process not go smoothly. You can use 
                        Windows’ built-in tools, but if they don’t allow you to create an image of your system on Windows 7, a third-party 
                        app like Macrium Reflect (free) is another great alternative.<br><br>
                        Also, make sure you’re using the latest BIOS from your laptop’s manufacturer before you start upgrading. With luck, 
                        that might help address whatever issues your system previously had installing Windows 10.(Once you’ve updated your BIOS,
                        consider resetting it to its default settings in case some strange setting is also affecting the Windows installation routine.)<br><br>
                        <h3>Some Windows 10 alternatives</h3><br>
                        If the upgrade process still doesn’t work, or if you’re waving the white flag on Windows 10, that’s totally fine.
                        At the very least, you can consider upgrading to Windows 8.1—not a huge step up from Windows 7, but one that gets you
                        three more years of extended support from Microsoft. You can install that for free, which is useful if you’re not sure 
                        if your laptop can even run it, and activate after-the-fact if all goes well.<br><br>
                        As for Linux, it’s certainly an option. I’d start by trying out a live session of something like Linux Mint. In other words,
                        you’ll be running the OS from a CD or flash drive instead of installing it directly on your system, so you can always
                        retreat back to Windows 7 if it feels like too much of a jump.<br><br>
                        You could also try CloudReady, which is based off Chromium OS—the very project that also serves as the foundation for
                        Google’s Chrome OS. It should feel familiar if you’ve ever touched a Chromebook. Even if you haven’t, it’s a great,
                        simpler option that shouldn’t scare away anyone who is only “slightly tech savvy,” as you describe yourself.
