                        Pressure from the global pandemic has broadband companies loosening the arbitrary restrictions on the connections users pay for — and this may be the
                        beginning of the end for the data caps we’ve lived in fear of for decades. Here’s why.
                        The coronavirus threat and official policies of “social distancing” are leading millions to stay home, doing meetings via video chat and probably
                        watching Netflix and YouTube the rest of the time. That means a big uptick in bytes going through the tubes, both simultaneously and cumulatively.
                        ISPs, leery of repeating Verizon’s memorable gaffe of cutting off service during an emergency, are proposing a variety of user-friendly changes to 
                        their policies. Comcast is boosting the bandwidth of its low-income Internet Essentials customers to levels that actually qualify as broadband under 
                        FCC rules. AT&T is suspending data caps for all its customers until further notice. Verizon has added $500 million to its 5G rollout plans. Wait,
                        how does that help? Unclear, but the company “stands ready” for increases in traffic.

                            Amazon  issued guidance Thursday in response to the COVID-19 outbreak recommending that global employees who are able to work from home to do so 
                            through the end of March.
                            “We continue to work closely with public and private medical experts to ensure we are taking the right precautions as the situation continues to
                            evolve,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email statement. “As a result, we are now recommending that all of our employees globally who are able
                            to work from home do so through the end of March.”

                            While you’ve probably spent a lot of today thinking about the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s worth remembering that other health 
                            issues aren’t going away — and that heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States.
                            Heartbeat Health is a startup working to improve the way that cardiovascular care is delivered, and it announced today that it has raised $8.2 million
                            in Series A funding.
