                        Like other powerful tools, technology can be used for great good or for great evil. Learn how people 
                        use technology for wrongdoing so you can protect yourself—or use their tricks to actually do good. 
                        Here are the top 10 “evil” ways you can use technology.
                    </p>
                    <ol reversed>
                        <li><h3>Spoof Called ID</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            Pranksters and scammers use caller ID spoofing to take advantage of us—in common telephone 
                            scams, for example, where “Microsoft” calls to warn you your computer has a virus and they’ll 
                            help you fix it (for a fee). There are legitimate reasons why you might want to make your 
                            phone number show up differently on caller ID (e.g., place a call to a young kid as Santa or Cinderella), 
                            and there are lots of spoofing apps and services to help you do this.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Uncover Blurred Information in Photos</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/blurred.webp" width="600" alt="blurred check"></center><br><br><br>
                            People blur out the information in photos to make sure sensitive information isn’t readable to others, 
                            but it turns out this strategy isn’t that secure—particularly when you’re trying to hide numbers. The 
                            takeaway: Don’t use simple mosaics to blur your image.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Create a USB Password Stealer</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/password stealer.webp" width="600" alt="password stealer"></center><br><br><br>
                            It’s bad enough that major password leaks happen so often, hackers can steal our passwords with just 
                            a USB flash drive and a single script, grabbing our cache of passwords stored in our browser and elsewhere.
                            You might want to test your vulnerability to this trick yourself, but either way, to protect yourself,
                            remember the security basics: always have physical control over your computer, use a secure password
                            manager (here’s how they compare, security-wise), and turn on two-factor authentication.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Get into a Private BitTorrent Tracker or Usenet Indexer</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            Private trackers and usenet indexers are great communities, but they take dedication and they’re hard
                            to get into. And there are strategies out there for getting into one that aren’t necessarily “evil,” you’ll be
                            working your way into exclusive private file sharing communities.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Spoof an Email Address</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/email spoof.webp" width="600" alt="email spoof"></center><br><br><br>
                            Caller ID isn’t the only thing spammers spoof. If you’ve ever gotten a strange, spammy email from 
                            a friend—or, worse, your email account just spammed all of your contacts—you know how annoying 
                            spoofed emails can be. Here’s how data thieves spoof email addresses to phish for information or 
                            con us into sending money to Nigerian princes. If you think you’ve been impersonated, you’ll need 
                            to take some advanced steps to secure your account.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Snoop on Someone’s Phone or Computer Without Them Knowing</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            Is your company monitoring you? Possibly. The NSA? Your ISP? Yeah. But it’s pretty easy too for a 
                            friend or family member to dig into your phone or computer without you knowing—whether by gaining 
                            physical access to your phone or computer or using remote monitoring tools. Parents might snoop on 
                            their kids, significant others might snoop on their partners out of insecurity or suspicion, whatever 
                            the reason, covering those snooping tracks isn’t that hard. If you think you might be the one being
                            snooped on, look for signs any of those stealthy steps weren’t followed. If you share a computer with
                            someone else, you have to know how to keep your data safe.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Crack a Wi-Fi Password</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/password crack.webp" width="600" alt="wifi password crack"></center><br><br><br>
                            WEP passwords are too easy to crack with tools like BackTrack making it super simple to get into a
                            WEP-”protected” router. That’s why everyone recommends using WPA—or really, WPA2, the latest encryption
                            standard. WPA can be cracked too, though! That is, if your router has WPS turned on. So disable WPS if
                            you can or try open-source router firmware like DD-WRT, which doesn’t support WPS.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Hack a Wi-Fi Network</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/wifi hack.webp" width="600" alt="wifi hack"></center><br><br><br>
                            Why would someone want to steal your router’s password? Besides stealing your Wi-Fi bandwidth, to spy 
                            on everything going on over your network, of course. It’s amazing the DIY creations hackers can use to
                            sniff out network packets. Fake routers and networks, created with the help of Kali Linux, for example,
                            can be used to trick machines into connecting, and then eavesdrop on network communications. 
                            (Yes, there’s a lot of spoofing going on in this article!) This is a good time to remind you to
                            check your router’s settings—especially these top security settings.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Sniff Out Passwords and Cookies</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            This is somewhat related to hacking a Wi-Fi network, but it’s more about the dangers of using public Wi-Fi.
                            It’s really easy for hackers to steal your logins and snoop on your browsing session, when the network is 
                            not secure or you’re connecting to sites that don’t use HTTPS. To protect yourself, your best bet is to use
                            a VPN whenever you’re using public Wi-Fi or follow some of these other safety precautions.
                        </p>
                        <li><h3>Break into a Computer</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            <center><img src="./asset/images/break into computer.webp" width="600" alt="break into computer"></center><br><br><br>
                            Finally, you might shudder to know it’s pretty easy to break into a computer, whether it’s a Windows PC or 
                            a Mac—even if your computer is password protected. If your computer is encrypted, however, such as with
                            BitLocker (for Windows) or FileVault (on Mac), you’ll be protected from some of the more common methods
                            hackers use to steal data from a computer. You’ll also want to make sure you have a very strong, unique
                            password for your computer login. If you get locked out of your computer, however, and forgot your 
                            password, well, now you know how to get back in.
                        </p>
